# flask-website-template

This is a template for a website using flask I made in about an hour. Run main.py and visit `localhost:5000` in your browser to test the template run. 
Main.py simply serves pages from templates, and templates gets CSS from static.

If you like how the template looks, you can try to make it work for what you need by changing the HTML templates given. If you don't like how the template looks, feel free to look online
and try to find html templates, just be sure to get the CSS that comes with them if there is any.

You can properly deploy this as a production server, though i cant really offer guidance.

DM me on discord BR2K1#9747 if you have any questions.
